# GoShop
GoShop is an Android application designed to help those who require assistance with their supermarket shopping. The app works by matching suitable trips with a driver's availability based on their given criteria, to create the best match. Both the driver and the user will be notified when a match has been made. The driver will be provided with a map of the route to follow within the app. The user will be collected at their given pickup point on their given date and time. The driver will bring them to their chosen supermarket, help them with their shopping and drop them home.
